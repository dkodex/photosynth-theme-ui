## Photosynth UI Theme

### Introduction

Photosynth UI is a dark theme inspired by simple and iconic green-on-black text
interface of such computers as Commodore PET, Apple II, TRS-80 and fictional devices
like terminals from the Fallout universe.

This particular theme styles the UI elements such as the tree view, the tabs,
drop-down lists, the status bar code and other elements inside the editor view.
